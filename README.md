![project component model](./src/images/WAY2WORK.PNG)

## **✅ `Requirements`**
* Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Install [Git v2.62.2+](https://git-scm.com/downloads/)
* Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## **💻 `Setup`**
* to clone this content, copy the url provided by the green 'Code' button in GitHub
* in command line use the command `git clone https://github.com/LINDGRENBA/way2work.git`
* open the program in a code editor
* navigate to the Way2Work directory and type `npm install` in the command line to install all of the necessary dependencies
* remaining in the Way2Work directory type `npm start` in the command line to run the program

## **🔍 `Stories`**
* A user should be able to create, update and delete a survey. All surveys should be stored in the database.
* A user should be able to fill out and submit surveys. Survey results should be submitted to the database. (A survey result can be associated to a survey by mimicking a one-to-many relationship.)
* A user should be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
* A user should have their own dashboard which lists the surveys they've created.

## **'Reach Goals'**
* Bonus: A user should be able to see the combined data on a survey in their dashboard. For instance, if a survey provides a 1-5 rating, return an average rating for all surveys.
* Challenging: Try using a library like D3 to visualize data from surveys. This is only recommended if you have time to spare, interest in data visualization, and are doing a week-long project.
* Dynamic forms where the user can add more questions as they create the survery (instead of a static number of questions)
